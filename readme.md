## Introduction

This repository provides implementations for various data structures and algorithms in both JavaScript and TypeScript. Each implementation includes basic operations and is intended for educational purposes.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `js/` - Contains JavaScript implementations.
- `ts/` - Contains TypeScript implementations.

## Data Structures

### Linked Lists

#### Singly Linked List

- **JavaScript**: [Singly Linked List Implementation](js/singly-linked-list.js)
- **TypeScript**: [Singly Linked List Implementation](ts/singly-linked-list.ts)

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element points to the next. This implementation supports basic operations like append, prepend, delete, and print.

#### Doubly Linked List

- **JavaScript**: [Doubly Linked List Implementation](js/doubly-linked-list.js)
- **TypeScript**: [Doubly Linked List Implementation](ts/doubly-linked-list.ts)

A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list but each node also points to its previous node. This implementation supports basic operations like append, prepend, delete, and print.

### Stack

- **JavaScript**: [Stack Implementation](js/stack.js)
- **TypeScript**: [Stack Implementation](ts/stack.ts)

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This implementation supports push, pop, peek, and check if empty.

### Queue

- **JavaScript**: [Queue Implementation](js/queue.js)
- **TypeScript**: [Queue Implementation](ts/queue.ts)

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This implementation supports enqueue, dequeue, peek, and check if empty.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**:
  - **JavaScript**: [Bubble Sort Implementation](js/bubble-sort.js)
  - **TypeScript**: [Bubble Sort Implementation](ts/bubble-sort.ts)

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Searching Algorithms

- **Binary Search**:
  - **JavaScript**: [Binary Search Implementation](js/binary-search.js)
  - **TypeScript**: [Binary Search Implementation](ts/binary-search.ts)

Binary search is a highly efficient search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
